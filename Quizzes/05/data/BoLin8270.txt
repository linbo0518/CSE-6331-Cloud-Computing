 2. Get files from this same folder.
   
 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4a. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
     (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")

 4b. Upload all data files (*csv, not this quiz) to cloud service. 

 4c. Screen capture (screen shots) may be saved as jpg, bmp, gif, or anything that we can see on our browsers. 
  
Show and submit code, when each part is complete, raise your hand and then show us:

 To recieve credit you MUST show (demo) AND submit the code (and screen shots) on Canvas.

 5.  Please deploy (show) a simple AWS webpage which will display:
     last 4 digits of your student ID, your name, and IP address, and below that the picture "aws.jpg" 
     below that show a counter, which you have implemented in your application, which starts at 0, and then
     continues to update (increment) at least once per second (you may implement this any way you wish)
     (in that order, top to bottom) 
     and show us (send us the URL in chat). 
     
     This should be the url of ElasticBeanstalk, or a Load balancer, not an individual EC2 instance
 
     If you are using Python the IP address can be obtained through:
        import requests
        ip = requests.get('https://checkip.amazonaws.com').text.strip()
        { Please make sure to include "requests" in your requirements.txt }
     
     If using PHP or another language, make an HTTP GET request to https://checkip.amazonaws.com 
     and show the resulting IP on your deployed app.

 6. Then, take a full-screen screenshot showing your AWS EC2 page with your single running instance. 
    Please ensure that all screenshots are FULL SCREEN with the OS date/time clearly visible as well as the AWS username,
    in the top right of the AWS management console.
    Save this as aws.jpg

 7. Start jmeter (locally) and run it (change parameters) until you get at least 1 (no more than 4) more EC2 instance 
    which were created by AWS for scaling.

 8. When your app has scaled to multiple instances, let us know in chat that #8 is ready. 
    (We should be able to see the IP address of the website change upon refreshing)

 9. Then screenshot the AWS EC2 page showing MULTIPLE running instances, (those created by AWS to scale your app). 
    Save this screenshot as mul.jpg

 10. Then, copy your two screen shots to AWS, and on AWS, deploy a simple webpage to show aws.jpg and mul.jpg
     and show us (send the URL in chat).

 11. When complete, return (send) this quiz
     If you finish early, send this immediately, otherwise send between
     the end of class and no more than 1 minute after that.
